## **Features**

### 1. Seasonal Temperature Trends
- A line plot depicting average temperatures across different seasons.

### 2. Correlation Heatmap
- A detailed heatmap illustrating relationships between numerical weather attributes.

### 3. Heat Stress Analysis
- Identification of days with a high Heat Stress Index (HSI > 30) using bar charts.

### 4. Monthly Rainfall Distribution
- Boxplots highlighting monthly variations in rainfall.

### 5. Wind Speed Analysis
- Histograms visualizing wind speed frequencies.

### 6. Seasonal Comparison of Weather Parameters
- Grouped bar charts comparing temperature, humidity, and rainfall across seasons.

## **Usage**

### Data Requirements
Prepare a CSV file containing the following columns:
- **Date**: Recorded date of weather data.
- **Temperature (C)**: Daily temperature in Celsius.
- **Humidity (%)**: Daily average humidity percentage.
- **Rainfall (mm)**: Daily rainfall in millimeters.
- **Wind Speed (km/h)**: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.
- **Heat Stress Index (optional)**: Calculated HSI values.

### Running the Scripts
1. Load the weather dataset into the `weather_data` DataFrame.
2. Execute the analysis scripts:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```
3. Visualizations will be generated automatically for each analysis.
